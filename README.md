# PWA: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. This allows the user to be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, the user is able to populate the total when brought back online. Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Thus, having offline functionality is crucial to the application's success.
